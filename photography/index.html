                <p>I discovered photography about eight years ago, when I stumbled upon my father’s old camera hidden in a drawer. That moment opened a door to a world where time could be frozen, a comforting contrast in a reality where everything feels so ephemeral.</p>
                <p>Photography quickly became more than a hobby; it became a way to preserve memories that would otherwise slip through the cracks. A way to capture the small stories happening around us, the ones that deserve to be remembered.</p>
                <p>I’ve always been drawn to animal, nature, and sports photography, the kind that requires patience, distance, and a bit of stealth. Hiding behind a bush waiting for wildlife to move naturally, or crouching behind a trackside banner as two-wheeled machines roar past… these moments are unpredictable, fleeting, and real. And that’s exactly why I love capturing them.</p>
                <p>Beyond real-life photography, I also explore game photography. Video games have always been a core part of my life, and the worlds within them are crafted with as much intention and beauty as anything in reality. Capturing moments inside these digital spaces feels like a dialogue between the player and the artists who built them; a way to frame their creativity through my own. It’s another canvas where I can chase light, composition, and emotion, even in places that exist only through imagination.</p>
