                        Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a love letter to fans of the saga starring those blue beings who, at first glance, have very human-like features, the Na’vi. Together with the release of Avatar 2: The Way of Water, the game has reignited many people’s interest. Massive Entertainment, a Ubisoft studio and developer of titles such as Far Cry 3, the upcoming Star Wars Outlaws, and the Tom Clancy's The Division series, brings us this visually stunning and mechanically fun work that lets us live the dream of exploring Pandora, defending it from hostile human forces, or flying an Ikran between floating mountains.

                        Once again, Sos Sosowski, originally known as Mikołaj Kamiński, surprises us with a new installment of the hilarious McPixel. In this sequel to the comedic graphic adventure, we take on the role of the character who gives the game its name, on his mission to become a hero, facing strange situations in which we must make the decisions we consider most correct (or not) to “save the day.”
