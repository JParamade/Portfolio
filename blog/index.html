                        It has now been five years since Quantic Dream jumped aboard the publishing train with Spotlight. Since then, it has published games like Under the Waves, Lysfanga, and the Sea of Solitude: The Director’s Cut for Nintendo Switch. Its next release, developed by Red Thread Games, is about to land on PC and on Sony and Microsoft’s eighth- and ninth-generation consoles. Dustborn throws you into a hilarious narrative action-adventure with a comic-book aesthetic, where a diverse group of friends, under the cover of a music band, must embark on a dangerous road trip across the United States to deliver a package of great importance.

                        The classic video game series Sensible Soccer, popular in the early 1990s, has received a spiritual successor led by Jon Hare and developed by Tower Studios and Combo Breaker. Football is one of the most widely played sports worldwide, so it’s no surprise that this type of game is so successful, as it allows football fans to enjoy the sport from home. In an industry dominated by Electronic Arts with its FC 24 (formerly FIFA), independent titles like Sociable Soccer 24 are carving out their own place, offering gameplay on par with that of the major North American studio.

                        Horror Tales: The Beggar is the latest horror release from Carlos Coronado, a true master of video game development in Unreal Engine, published by Jandusoft. Coronado is a certified authorized instructor and has won numerous awards, including several MegaGrants granted by Epic Games itself. This title is the sequel to The Wine, the first installment of the Horror Tales saga. Narratively, we are placed years after the apocalyptic events of The Wine, embodying a beggar who has been subjected to experiments with a toxic wine that causes terrifying hallucinations. Horror Tales: The Beggar has just landed today on Steam, PS4/PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.

                        This past Wednesday, we had the great pleasure of attending the talk given by Michael Santorum at U-tad on “how video games tell stories.” He is a game developer and instructor who began his career in the industry as a designer on Commandos 2 and Commandos 3 (Pyro Studios, 2001–2003). Later in his career, he worked as Lead QA on Castlevania: Lords of Shadow (MercurySteam, 2010), where he interestingly met Kojima during a visit the Japanese developer made to the studio. In 2013, he joined the design team at Tequila Works, working on RiME and The Invisible Hours, which led him to his current role as Narrative Director. We also saw him on the stage of U-tad’s own Jugando en Casa gala, where, alongside José Raluy and Estefanía Salcedo, he received a recognition for the trajectory of the Madrid-based studio.

                        The genre of first-person narrative adventures, commonly known aswalking simulators, has been gaining presence in the video game industry over the years. We’ve been able to enjoy great titles in this genre such as Gone Home, Firewatch, What Remains of Edith Finch, or Virginia, where the experience focuses on narrative progression through environmental exploration. One O One Games offers us this mysterious adventure with a slight touch of horror, one that stands proudly alongside its competitors.

                        Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a love letter to fans of the saga starring those blue beings who, at first glance, have very human-like features, the Na’vi. Together with the release of Avatar 2: The Way of Water, the game has reignited many people’s interest. Massive Entertainment, a Ubisoft studio and developer of titles such as Far Cry 3, the upcoming Star Wars Outlaws, and the Tom Clancy's The Division series, brings us this visually stunning and mechanically fun work that lets us live the dream of exploring Pandora, defending it from hostile human forces, or flying an Ikran between floating mountains.

                        Once again, Sos Sosowski, originally known as Mikołaj Kamiński, surprises us with a new installment of the hilarious McPixel. In this sequel to the comedic graphic adventure, we take on the role of the character who gives the game its name, on his mission to become a hero, facing strange situations in which we must make the decisions we consider most correct (or not) to “save the day.”
