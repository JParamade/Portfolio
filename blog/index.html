                        This past Wednesday, we had the great pleasure of attending the talk given by Michael Santorum at U-tad on “how video games tell stories.” He is a game developer and instructor who began his career in the industry as a designer on Commandos 2 and Commandos 3 (Pyro Studios, 2001–2003). Later in his career, he worked as Lead QA on Castlevania: Lords of Shadow (MercurySteam, 2010), where he interestingly met Kojima during a visit the Japanese developer made to the studio. In 2013, he joined the design team at Tequila Works, working on RiME and The Invisible Hours, which led him to his current role as Narrative Director. We also saw him on the stage of U-tad’s own Jugando en Casa gala, where, alongside José Raluy and Estefanía Salcedo, he received a recognition for the trajectory of the Madrid-based studio.

                        The genre of first-person narrative adventures, commonly known aswalking simulators, has been gaining presence in the video game industry over the years. We’ve been able to enjoy great titles in this genre such as Gone Home, Firewatch, What Remains of Edith Finch, or Virginia, where the experience focuses on narrative progression through environmental exploration. One O One Games offers us this mysterious adventure with a slight touch of horror, one that stands proudly alongside its competitors.

                        Have you ever imagined what the world would look like after facing the devastation caused by human beings? Piccolo Studio brings us this wonderful, thought-provoking experience that criticizes the environmental impact human actions have had on nature.

                        Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a love letter to fans of the saga starring those blue beings who, at first glance, have very human-like features, the Na’vi. Together with the release of Avatar 2: The Way of Water, the game has reignited many people’s interest. Massive Entertainment, a Ubisoft studio and developer of titles such as Far Cry 3, the upcoming Star Wars Outlaws, and the Tom Clancy's The Division series, brings us this visually stunning and mechanically fun work that lets us live the dream of exploring Pandora, defending it from hostile human forces, or flying an Ikran between floating mountains.

                        Once again, Sos Sosowski, originally known as Mikołaj Kamiński, surprises us with a new installment of the hilarious McPixel. In this sequel to the comedic graphic adventure, we take on the role of the character who gives the game its name, on his mission to become a hero, facing strange situations in which we must make the decisions we consider most correct (or not) to “save the day.”
