                    <p>Have you ever imagined what the world would look like after facing the devastation caused by human beings? <b>Piccolo Studio</b> brings us this wonderful, thought-provoking experience that criticizes the environmental impact human actions have had on nature.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>After Us</b> is not just a platformer, but a journey that stands out for its stunning visuals, magical sound design, and environmental storytelling that invites you to reflect on our relationship with nature. We take on the role of a young nymph who personifies the spirit of Gaia, better known as the goddess of the Earth in Greek mythology. We must help her overcome obstacles and puzzles in her quest to recover the spirits of certain living beings and, in doing so, restore life to the planet.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the adventure, we will pass through worlds filled with <b>petrified humans</b> and elements that allude to the destruction of nature, such as hunting, deforestation, and industrialization. As you progress through the story, you’ll realize that not all humans have turned to stone. These are the Devourers, who will attempt to hinder your progress toward your goal.</p>

                    <p>At first glance, the message the game wants to convey is clear. However, Piccolo Studio has <b>hidden small optional clues</b> throughout the game that present a completely different perspective. We invite you to discover it for yourself.</p>
