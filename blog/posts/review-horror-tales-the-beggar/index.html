                <div class="full-post-content">
                    <p><b>Horror Tales: The Beggar</b> is the latest horror release from <b>Carlos Coronado</b>, a true master of video game development in Unreal Engine, published by <b>Jandusoft</b>. Coronado is a certified authorized instructor and has won numerous awards, including several MegaGrants granted by Epic Games itself. This title is the sequel to The Wine, the first installment of the Horror Tales saga. Narratively, we are placed years after the apocalyptic events of The Wine, embodying a beggar who has been subjected to experiments with a toxic wine that causes terrifying hallucinations. Horror Tales: The Beggar has just landed today on Steam, PS4/PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

                    <h2>Next-Gen graphics</h2>
                    <p>The game’s visual side, which embraces <b>hyperrealism</b>, is spectacular. The combination of the author's signature style with Unreal Engine 5 gives us highly promising visuals. Additionally, it includes a <b>photo mode</b> that, although not very extensive in photographic parameters, offers the basic customization tools needed to capture high-quality shots of its impressive artistic design.<p>
                    
                    <h2>Immersive puzzle-focused gameplay</h2>
                    <p>In terms of design, the gameplay revolves around <b>environmental puzzles</b> combined with certain platforming elements, where the player must use two main mechanics to progress. The most spectacular and relevant one, without a doubt, is changing the time of day or weather. Depending on the <b>time of day</b> the player chooses, elements of the environment will be in different positions, granting access to new areas. Visually, this mechanic resembles a time-lapse, where time passes quickly, accelerating the action while allowing the player to enjoy the transition between, for example, day and night. The secondary mechanic, which also forms the foundation of the game’s combat system, is grabbing and throwing props from the environment. This not only allows players to attack enemies encountered throughout the adventure, but also lets them break selected structures to clear a path.<p>

                    <p>The narrative involves us in a mystery story that progressively gives clues about the main character’s situation. Throughout the story, we are given certain moments of <b>tension</b>, those beloved by horror fans, that properly regulate the game’s pacing in combination with the narrative progression and puzzles. Horror Tales: The Beggar delivers absolutely epic final moments, which we won’t spoil so you can experience them yourself.<p>

                    <h2>More than just a horror game</h2>
                    <p>Once again, Carlos Coronado does not disappoint with an interactive product offering around four hours of content, filled with emotion. We remind you that on <b>July 12</b>, the physical edition arrives thanks to <b>Tesura Games</b>, featuring a glow-in-the-dark cover and a code that grants digital access to the first installment in the saga, Horror Tales: The Wine.<p>
