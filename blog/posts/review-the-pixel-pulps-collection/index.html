                <div class="full-post-content">
                    <p>The creative talents of Nico Saraintaris and Fernando Martínez Ruppel, novelist and artist respectively, come together in this <b>first volume of the Pixel Pulps anthology</b>. This collection of <b>three video games</b>, inspired by 1950s pulp fiction and 1980s computer graphics, pays tribute to the golden age of adventure games. Something that becomes evident shortly after starting these adventures is their <b>exquisite narrative writing and striking illustration</b>. In <b>Mothmen 1966, Varney Lake, and Bahnsen Knights</b>, we dive into short novels of roughly two hours each, filled with mystery, camaraderie, and horror.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Mothmen 1966</h2>
                    <p>The paths of a gas station owner, a young couple, and a paranormal investigator cross during an event that occurs every 33 years: the <b>Leonid meteor shower</b>. This astral phenomenon triggers a series of paranormal events that quickly entangle these characters and some of their loved ones. Escape from the nocturnal creatures and stay alert, <b>the Men in Black are watching</b>.</p>

                    <h2>Varney Lake</h2>
                    <p>It’s 1954, summer is beginning, and a group of three friends already have their <b>perfect vacation planned</b>. Amid many activities, games, and fun adventures around Varney Lake, while running from bullies, they stumble upon a <b>dying vampire whom they decide to help</b>. One member of the group disappears, and years later the others uncover <b>startling news</b>. Join Jimmy, Christine, and Doug in their exciting summer and <b>discover what’s happening in Varney Lake</b>.</p>

                    <h2>Bahnsen Knights</h2>
                    <p>Boulder, a secret agent, infiltrates a religious cult known as the Bahnsen Knights, which operates in the <b>Tornado Alley region of the United States in the late 20th century</b>. He must <b>maintain his cover</b> while dealing with cultists, biblical tornadoes, and Toni, a charismatic car salesman turned preacher and current leader of the cult. His mission is to <b>find clues about the mysterious disappearance of a fellow agent and close friend</b>. Avoid blowing your cover and find your friend.</p>

                    <h2>A connected paranormal universe</h2>
                    <p>The stories in the first volume of the Pixel Pulps anthology not only showcase <b>exquisite narrative craft</b> that captivates with mystery, they also take place within the same universe, filled with paranormal cases that open the door to <b>more interconnected stories in the future</b>. Across the different narratives, we can spot characters who appear across multiple stories in different points in time and space. Without a doubt, there is one particular character who is vital to all the stories, but we won’t reveal who it is so you can discover it yourself.</p>

                    <h2>Puzzles or choices</h2>
                    <p>It’s clear that for a <b>text-based adventure</b> to be more than just a <b>narrated tale</b>, it must include <b>interaction</b>. The way to involve the player in a story is by allowing them to make decisions—and this first volume is full of them. Even within the included minigames, the gameplay revolves around <b>choosing the next action to take</b>. Although these minigames might seem like replicas of traditional games, such as solitaire, <b>they feature a special twist that makes them entirely unique</b>.</p>
