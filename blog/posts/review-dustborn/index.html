                <h1 class="full-post-title">[Review] Dustborn</h1>
                <div class="full-post-content">
                    <p>It has now been five years since <b>Quantic Dream</b> jumped aboard the publishing train with <b>Spotlight</b>. Since then, it has published games like <b>Under the Waves</b>, <b>Lysfanga</b>, and the <b>Sea of Solitude: Director’s Cut</b> for Nintendo Switch. Its next release, developed by <b>Red Thread Games</b>, is about to land on PC and on Sony and Microsoft’s eighth- and ninth-generation consoles. Dustborn throws you into a hilarious narrative action-adventure with a <b>comic-book aesthetic</b>, where a diverse group of friends, under the cover of a music band, must embark on a dangerous road trip across the United States to deliver a package of great importance.</p>

                    <h2>The power of words</h2>
                    <p>In the universe of Dustborn, not only do ordinary humans coexist, but also anomalous people. These individuals, although human, share one trait: they possess <b>special powers</b> when using words. Our protagonist, Pax, is an exile and con artist who can wield words as weapons. The correct use of these words not only determines the <b>fate of the characters and their relationships</b>, but can also be used to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, or overcome obstacles.</p>
                    <p>As the leader of the Dustborn crew, Pax must <b>command her squad</b>, making the most of her companions’ abilities in every situation. There is more than one way to solve many challenges, but the decisions you make will affect the timeline, <b>shaping the narrative outcome</b>.</p>

                    <h2>Narrative under the Quantic Dream seal</h2>
                    <p>Quantic Dream has proven its mastery of narrative with major titles like <b>Heavy Rain</b>, <b>Beyond: Two Souls</b>, and <b>Detroit: Become Human</b>, and Dustborn is no different. Red Thread Games has crafted a narrative adventure with an <b>interesting, entertaining plot</b> and a cast of charismatic characters. The narrative design offers content for every type of player, <b>whether you're only interested in the main story or want to dive deeper into character relationships and subplots</b>. It also includes several technical innovations that add <b>depth and realism to conversations</b> and allow the narrative experience to be tailored to the player’s taste.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Live dialogues:</u> At certain moments during conversations, the player is warned when the dialogue is about to <b>shift topics</b>. You must respond quickly or you may lose your chance to intervene. This new feature <b>makes the dialogue feel alive and realistic</b>, as characters do not stand around waiting for the player’s response.</li>
                        <li><u>Dynamic conversational perspective:</u> During most conversations, players can <b>choose the camera angle</b>. This allows for different views of the same conversation and lets you observe all characters’ facial expressions. Even so, the developers have given extra weight to the main shots so that players who prefer it can experience the game as the Norwegian studio originally designed it.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4-in-1: Narrative, exploration, rhythm and combat</h2>
                    <p>Dustborn <b>brings together a wide array of mechanics from different genres</b>, and does it very well. Branching narrative, world exploration, rhythm minigames, and third-person combat blend into a cohesive title built on strong storytelling foundations. Without a doubt, the highlight of Dustborn’s exploration is <b>ME'EM</b>, a portable console that accompanies you throughout your journey. A fun detail is that it can be taken out during conversations, and Pax will display it in real time on screen.</p>
