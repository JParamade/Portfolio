                <div class="full-post-content">
                    <p>Once again, Sos Sosowski, originally known as <b>Mikołaj Kamiński</b>, surprises us with a new installment of the hilarious McPixel. In this sequel to the comedic graphic adventure, we take on the role of the character who gives the game its name, on his mission to become a hero, facing strange situations in which we must make the decisions we consider most correct (or not) to “save the day.”</p>
                    
                    <h2>What happened to McPixel 2?</h2>
                    <p>You’ve probably wondered how it’s possible for McPixel 3 to be a sequel to McPixel and, therefore, where <b>McPixel 2</b> went. Since this is such a peculiar game, it’s not surprising that they make these nonsensical decisions. However, this isn’t the only game to adopt such a wild numbering system, the classic goat simulator <b>Goat Simulator</b> also skipped the second installment and numbered its second game as 3. Not much is really known about this decision, but the development team (together with Devolver Digital) gave us this original gag.</p>

                    <h2>McPixel 3 is a bible of references</h2>
                    <p>If the original game already included references to pop culture characters (with the main character itself parodying the famous bomb-defuser <b>MacGyver</b>), this new installment takes it to the next level. Throughout <b>more than 100 levels</b>, you can find references in the form of parodies of movies, books, legends, and even other video games and genres.</p>
                    <p>Undoubtedly, one of the best references is to the video game <b>Among Us</b>. In this level, you’ll have to try to guess who the impostor on the spaceship is in a very fun and unique way that we’ll let you discover when you play.</p>

                    <h2>Depth in Gameplay with simple mechanics</h2>
                    <p>What stands out the most in this sequel is the variety and originality of the minigames. Each one feels completely different from the last, which allows the gameplay to have great depth despite its mechanical minimalism.</p>
                    <p>With this mechanical simplicity, the game leans into the nostalgia of arcade machines where a single button handles all actions, clearly accompanied by the pixel art style that so well defines this saga.</p>

                    <h2>A strange but unique experience</h2>
                    <p>McPixel 3 is definitely not the game we’re used to, but I assure you that’s exactly what makes it special. This game will make you laugh for hours and experience situations you’ve (most likely) never encountered before, and in the most absurd way you can imagine. This makes McPixel 3 a unique experience that you won’t regret trying.</p>
